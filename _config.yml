  I'm a lead cloud native engineer. Normally this means leading a team of engineers with a focus on cloud-technologies, I work both technically as well as interacting with the customer and ensuring we are building a solution that they need. When I'm not doing that I'm working on Pre-Sales, running trainings or working on internal projects to improve openness and satisfaction within the company.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Kubernetes & Docker</mark>, <mark>Python</mark> & <mark>Technical to non-Technical translation</mark>
