</p><p>I‚Äôm a lead cloud native engineer. Normally this means managing a team of engineers with a focus on cloud-technologies.
I work technically, and interface continuously with the customer to ensure we are building the solution they need.
When I‚Äôm not doing that I‚Äôm running trainings in Kubernetes &amp; Docker,
working on Pre-Sales or carrying out internal projects to improve openness and satisfaction within the company.</p>

<p>Projects I have worked on include</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building a tool to inspect the Kubernetes cluster and construct enriched data for consumption by other services</li>
  <li>Build out an enterprise-scale CICD and PaaS offering including Jenkins, SonarQube and Open Policy Agent in Google Cloud</li>
  <li>Advise and implement a number of PoC‚Äôs for companies interested in exploring Kubernetes and Cloud Native.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p>During this period I worked on building a JavaScript library to support Fluid-Dynamics Engineers in building an improved UX for running complex calculations.
This was a longer project involving diving into C# to help build an API as well as Fortran to standardise data IO to be machine-readable.
The library took considerable planning and engineering time to fully encapsulate the complexities and flexibility required for a generic interface over the formulas.</p>

As a Data Engineer I was involved in building a machine-learning model, as well as architecting the supporting architecture.
Additionally I introduced and supported the rollout of Docker within the company. This process involved building and packaging multiple different processes (within Docker),
providing support for Docker-specific issues as well as providing training to colleagues as I onboarded them.</p>

</p><p>I run nixpkgs on my chromebook (within Crostini), as well as on all my servers/linux laptops.
It is a declarative approach to defining package-sets and configuration for a system,

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-3 col-print-12 details"><h4>University of Edinburgh</h4><p><b>BSc Computer Science</b></p><p>2013 -2017</p></div>
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p class="quote">Machine Learning & Programming Language Theory
</p><p>My academic focus at Edinburgh centered around machine-learning, data-science, building scalable systems and programming language theory. Through my thesis I developed a tool to automatically extract runtime type information from JavaScript and generate Typescript definition files. I came to this topic through one of my professors who‚Äôs research this was inspired by (<a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/blame.html">blame calculus</a>).</p>

<p>Outside of academia, I was (and still am) a member of a group of SysAdmins running &amp; maintaining a set of physical servers located on-campus. The project runs a diverse array of different services (GitLab, LDAP, IRC Server, Mail Server as well as any long-running projects that students may want to run in a less regulated and more experimental environment).
During University I also worked within the field as an intern, both over summer and part-time during semesters.</p>
