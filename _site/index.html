      <p>I’m a lead cloud native engineer. Normally this means leading a team of engineers with a focus on cloud-technologies, I work both technically as well as interacting with the customer and ensuring we are building a solution that they need. When I’m not doing that I’m working on Pre-Sales, running trainings or working on internal projects to improve openness and satisfaction within the company.</p>

</p><p>I run nixpkgs on my chromebook (within Crostini), as well as on all my servers/linux laptops.
It is a declarative approach to defining package-sets and configuration for a system,
whether that be a set of interacting applications or a full-blown operating-system.
I have started putting together a set of packages for running within Chromebook’s Crostini environment.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p>During this period I worked on building a JavaScript library to support Fluid Engineers in building an improved UX for running complicated calculations. This was a longer project involving diving into C# to help build an API as well as Fortran to standardise data IO to be machine-readable.
The library took considerable planning and engineering time to fully encapsulate the complexities and flexibility required for a generic interface over engineering formulas.</p>

As a Data Engineer I was involved in building a machine-learning model, as well as architecting the ML supporting architecture.
Additionally I introduced and supported the rollout of Docker within the company. This process involved building and packaging multiple different processes, providing support for Docker-specific issues as well as providing (informal) training to colleagues as I onboarded them.</p>

</p><p>My time in Edinburgh was filled with a number of curricular and extra-curricular activities. Within the University I learned about machine-learning and data-science, building scalable systems and Programming language theory. I attended a number of events focussing on programming language theory and wrote my thesis based on a tool to automatically extract type information from JavaScript.</p>

<p>Additionally I was (and still am) a member of a group of SysAdmins running &amp; maintaining a set of physical servers located on-campus. The project runs a diverse array of different services (GitLab, LDAP, IRC Server, Mail Server as well as any long-running projects that students may want to run in a less regulated/more experimental environment).</p>

<p>During University I also worked within the field as an intern, both over summer and part-time during semesters.</p>
