    I run nixpkgs on my chromebook (within Crostini), as well as on all my servers/linux laptops.
    It is a declarative approach to defining package-sets and configuration for a system,
    whether that be a set of interacting applications or a full-blown operating-system.
    I have started putting together a set of packages for running within Chromebook's Crostini environment.
