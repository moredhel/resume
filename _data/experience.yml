    We are a cloud consulting company. I am occupied with managing engineers and diving into the technical details when necessary.
    I also am involved in the planning and architecture of systems when first approaching customers.
    Another aspect of my job is to attend and provide input in pre-sales meetings to gauge the clients current architectural state, what their current problem is and to propose some initial steps to take.

    I have worked a number of roles here, ranging from Software-Engineer to Cloud Architect. I am also involved internally with IT Support.

    During this period I worked on building a JavaScript library to support Fluid Engineers in building an improved UX for running complicated calculations. This was a longer project involving diving into C# to help build an API as well as Fortran to standardise data IO to be machine-readable.
    The library took considerable planning and engineering time to fully encapsulate the complexities and flexibility required for a generic interface over engineering formulas.

    During my first experience I was heavily involved in migrating a 500k LOC rails project from rails3 to rails4.
    As a Data Engineer I was involved in building a machine-learning model, as well as architecting the ML supporting architecture.
    Additionally I introduced and supported the rollout of Docker within the company. This process involved building and packaging multiple different processes, providing support for Docker-specific issues as well as providing (informal) training to colleagues as I onboarded them.
