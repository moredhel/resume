    Building Cloud Native Confidence
  description: |
    I’m a lead cloud native engineer. Normally this means managing a team of engineers with a focus on cloud-technologies.
    I work technically, and interface continuously with the customer to ensure we are building the solution they need.
    When I’m not doing that I’m running trainings in Kubernetes & Docker,
    working on Pre-Sales or carrying out internal projects to improve openness and satisfaction within the company.  

    Projects I have worked on include

    - Building a tool to inspect the Kubernetes cluster and construct enriched data for consumption by other services
    - Build out an enterprise-scale CICD and PaaS offering including Jenkins, SonarQube and Open Policy Agent in Google Cloud
    - Advise and implement a number of PoC's for companies interested in exploring Kubernetes and Cloud Native.

    During this period I worked on building a JavaScript library to support Fluid-Dynamics Engineers in building an improved UX for running complex calculations.
    This was a longer project involving diving into C# to help build an API as well as Fortran to standardise data IO to be machine-readable.
    The library took considerable planning and engineering time to fully encapsulate the complexities and flexibility required for a generic interface over the formulas.

    During my first experience I was heavily involved in migrating a 500k LOC rails project from rails3 to rails4.
    As a Data Engineer I was involved in building a machine-learning model, as well as architecting the supporting architecture.
    Additionally I introduced and supported the rollout of Docker within the company. This process involved building and packaging multiple different processes (within Docker),
    providing support for Docker-specific issues as well as providing training to colleagues as I onboarded them.
