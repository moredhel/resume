    Cloud Native Consultancy Cooperative
  description: |
    In May 2020 a few friends & I founded a Cooperative with the goal of
    providing Cloud Native Consultancy. We wanted to create a supportive &
    inclusive, engineering-driven company with a focus on long-term stability &
    a healthy professional social environment.

    We had all been independent consultants for a few years by that point & felt
    that there are things that by being your own entity definitely one loses out
    on. Specifically, the community aspect of a company environment can
    definitely mean quiet days.

    The Cooperative is growing steadily, starting at 4 founding members we are
    now up to 12 in 18 months, with a wider community having grown up around us.

    Automated infrastructure & Dev support
  description: |
    I focus on building out and automating the infrastructure for
    multiple services across 5 different geographical regions.  This
    ranges from infrastructure automation using Terraform to providing
    feedback and guidance on technical decisions for the architecture
    of running systems.

    We work as a close team, following GitOps principles & maintaining
    a complex set of dependent services across multiple environments.

    I work closely with the developers, directly contributing to the
    services themselves when the need arises. I also worked with the
    devs to enable them to take more control of their services
    throught the lifecycle, from development all the way through to
    production.

    I work on the following technologies on a daily basis:
      - Azure Cloud
      - Terraform
      - CICD
      - Python
      - TypeScript

    Building Cloud Native Confidence
  description: |
    I’m a lead cloud native engineer. Normally this means managing a
    team of engineers with a focus on cloud-technologies.  I work
    technically, both writing code and discussing the architectural
    direction with the client.  When I’m not doing that I’m running
    trainings in Kubernetes & Docker, working on Pre-Sales or carrying
    out internal projects to improve openness and satisfaction within
    the company.

    Projects I have worked on include

    - Building a tool to inspect the Kubernetes cluster and construct
      enriched data for consumption by other services
    - Build out an enterprise-scale CICD and PaaS offering including
      Jenkins, SonarQube and Open Policy Agent in Google Cloud
    - Advise and implement a number of PoC's for companies interested
      in exploring Kubernetes and Cloud Native.

    During this period I worked on building a JavaScript library to
    support Fluid-Dynamics Engineers in building an improved UX for
    running complex calculations.  This was a longer project involving
    diving into C# to help build an API as well as Fortran to
    standardise data IO to be machine-readable.  The library took
    considerable planning and engineering time to fully encapsulate
    the complexities and flexibility required for a generic interface
    over the formulas.

  job_title: Data Engineer & Software Engineer (Intern)
  dates: May 2015 - September 2015 &  May 2016 - September 2016
  description: |
    During my first experience I was heavily involved in migrating a
    500k LOC rails project from rails3 to rails4.  As a Data Engineer
    I was involved in building a machine-learning model, as well as
    architecting the supporting architecture.  Additionally I
    introduced and supported the rollout of Docker within the
    company. This process involved building and packaging multiple
    different processes (within Docker), providing support for
    Docker-specific issues as well as providing training to colleagues
    as I onboarded them.
