    Machine Learning & Programming Language Theory
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    My time in Edinburgh was filled with a number of curricular and extra-curricular activities. Within the University I learned about machine-learning and data-science, building scalable systems and Programming language theory. I attended a number of events focussing on programming language theory and wrote my thesis based on a tool to automatically extract type information from JavaScript.

    Additionally I was (and still am) a member of a group of SysAdmins running & maintainig a set of physical servers located on-campus. The project runs a diverse array of different services (GitLab, LDAP, IRC Server, Mail Server as well as any long-running projects that students may want to run in a less regulated environment).

    During University I also worked within the field as an intern, both over Summer and part-time during Semesters.
